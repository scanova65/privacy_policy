# Privacy Policy for Scanova

**Last Updated: May 10, 2025**

Welcome to Scanova! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our app to scan text from images and copy it to your device.

## 1. Information We Collect
- **No Personal Data Collected**: Our app operates offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information such as your name, email, or location unless you choose to share it.
- **Image and Text Data**: When you scan an image, the app processes the image locally on your device to extract text. This text is only stored temporarily on your device and can be copied by you. We do not access, save, or send this data to any server.
- **Optional Feedback**: If you contact us with feedback or support requests, you may provide personal information (e.g., your email). This data is used only to respond to you and is not stored long-term.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- The app uses image and text data solely to perform the text extraction function on your device.
- We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purpose.
- If you provide feedback, we use it to improve the app and respond to your inquiries.

## 3. How We Share Your Information
- We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.
- Your image and text data remain on your device and are not shared with us or anyone else.

## 4. Data Security
- Since the app processes data locally, we do not have access to it. Your device’s security features protect the data.
- We recommend keeping your device secure (e.g., with a password) to safeguard the text you extract.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
- Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that we have, we will delete it immediately.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy as our app evolves. We will notify you of changes by posting the new policy here with an updated date.

## 7. Contact Us
- If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at [support@scanovaapp.com](mailto:support@scanovaapp.com).
- You can also request the deletion of any feedback data you’ve shared by contacting us.
